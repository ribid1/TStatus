# TStatus
Displays and announces the turbine status of all kind of turbines  
You can add Turbines which are not already in the list, by edit the file TStatus.jsn  
For example you could add a Turbine called "Xicoy-de" and translate the messages in German, than you can either choose the german or the englisch Messages.  
Also you can edit the file Tlang.jsn for wave files in a different language. Just put the wave file in the \Audio folder and change the Tlang.jsn accordingly.  
So you could read the message for example in englisch, and hear it in german, or vis a verca.  
All wave files for the Jetsmunt(Xicoy) Turbine are in the TStatus_Audio.zip file, if you have a different Turbine,  
but the message is the same you will hear the message also, but if there is no wave file for this message, you will hear nothing until you get a wave file  
and edit the Tlang.jsn

You can use the app in combination with the dbdis app: https://github.com/ribid1/dbdis
